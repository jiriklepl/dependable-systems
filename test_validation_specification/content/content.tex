\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

The purpose of this document is to describe the system testing, analysis, inspection and
review of design specifications to be performed as part of the software validation plan for
the Line Follower Challenge Robot DD48879 (CSR/DD48879).

System tests verify that the software system meets the software requirements with primary
purpose to fully exercise the complete system. If possible, tests must be executed by an
independent team in a development and/or operational environment. Knowledge of the
system is not needed, so system testing is essentially a black-box test.

Hopefully, you do not read any further to discover that this introduction was copied almost
verbatim from the Cluster Science Archive Software Validation Specification. That would be
too bad for us, since it would then be obvious to you that we are just shameless plagiators.

Test cases described in this document are mainly based on functional requirements. Non-
functional requirements (e.g. interface, resource, reliability and safety tests) are out of the
scope of the document with the exception of the performance, scalability and security tests,
which have proven to be of key importance for any release of a science archive system.

This document is fully compatible with the European Cooperation for Space
Standardization (ECSS) (see [ECSS-E-ST-40C]), and it constitutes the Software Validation
Specification (SVS) deliverable, which aims to validate process implementation and
activities with respect to the technical specification and the requirements baseline.


\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to describe the system testing, analysis, inspection and
review of design specifications to be performed as part of the software validation plan for
the Line Follower Challenge Robot DD48879 (CSR/DD48879), as said in the first chapter.
